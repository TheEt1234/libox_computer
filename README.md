# Libox_computer
basically a mooncontroller + digilines touchscreen + libox coroutine sandboxes

You can color it (from code) if unified dyes is enabled

(you can make a display with this actually, but that is an excercise for the viewer... probably a horrible idea)

# Support
- mesecons_debug: one of the main things it does is limit mesecon queue, libox_computer does use mesecon queue so it is compatible
- mesecons: the libox_computer mod does not interface with mesecons in an obvious way but it relies on functions from it (like the mesecon queue mentioned earlier)
- digilines: the laptop has digilines I/O
